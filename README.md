## Description:
We’ve decided to open a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles. The project is promising but expensive, so we decide to try to attract investors. They’re interested in the current market conditions — will we be able to maintain our success when the novelty of robot waiters wears off? we have asked to prepare some market research using open-source data on restaurants in LA.
